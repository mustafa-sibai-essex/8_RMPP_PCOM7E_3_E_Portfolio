## Instructions: 
Think about which data collection tool will be suitable for your area of investigation (in this module and/or in your Project module). How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How will this answer your research question?

## Answer:
I plan to investigate Mobile App development for people with disabilities. For data collection, I would use a questionnaire with a mix of both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. For my multiple-choice questions, I want to understand and know what kind of apps people with disabilities use daily. For my open-ended questions, I want to know which accessibility features are prioritised by app developers when making an application with accessibility features in mind.
