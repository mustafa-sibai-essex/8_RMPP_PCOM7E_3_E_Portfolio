Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:
•	Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
•	Which data collection methods would you consider using?

My aim for this my research is to explore Mobile App Development Challenges for people with disabilities. The methodology used for this research will be a mix of quantitative and qualitative in nature. 
For data collection methods I will be employing the use of questionnaires. These can be administered to a large and diverse group of developers, users, and accessibility experts. Questionnaires can include both closed-ended and open-ended questions to gather quantitative and qualitative data on challenges, costs, and resource requirements. Furthermore, I will be observing the development process of mobile and video game applications, especially when accessibility features are being added which can provide firsthand data on the challenges faced and the resources consumed.
