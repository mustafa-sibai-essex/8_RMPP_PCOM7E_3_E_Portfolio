Instructions: Please read the case below and answer the questions. You need to determine the ethical issues involved with this case.

## THE CASE
Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.

Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.

Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?

If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?
Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?
Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?
Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?

## ANSWER:

1.	If Ricardo is not responsible for determining who has access, he should not release the names and addresses. This would be a massive violation of privacy.
2.	Ricardo should not grant access to personal information if he did not get consent from each person. Without the consent, this would be a huge violation of privacy.
3.	Unless the person who has given their information give a clear consent to be contacted, Beth has no right to contact them at all. If Beth would contact them, this would be a massive breach of privacy.
4.	Beth should get consent from all parties to be included in her study. You cannot presume consent just because the majority consented.
